Don't hesitate to create [issues](https://github.com/crashinvaders/gdx-lml/issues), especially if you plan on implementing a new feature rather than submit a simple fix. New functionalities without dedicated issues (where they can be discussed and analyzed) will **not** be merged. If you need help with any of the libraries or consider the documentation lacking, creating a new issue or commenting an existing one is the preferred way of contacting the maintainers.
