# LibGDX Autumn FCS

Desktop "natives" for [LibGDX Autumn](../../..) - dependency injection with component scan mechanism.

## Scanner

`DesktopClassScanner` implements Autumn's `ClassScanner` interface and is the default scanner for desktop applications. It uses [`ClassGraph`](https://github.com/classgraph/classgraph) library for efficient scanning that does not depend on reflection. Basically, it is a thin wrapper over `ClassGraph` class, satisfying Autumn's needs.

### Alternatives

If, for some reason, class scanning does not work on your desktop target platform or you do not want another dependency, you can try to use `FallbackDesktopClassScanner` (from basic `gdx-autumn` library) - it uses reflection to look for annotations, so it's much less efficient. `FDCS` is compatible with Java 6. If `FDCS` is also not an option, use `FixedClassScanner` and provide classes that you want to be scanned - while this defeats the whole purpose of automated class scanning, it should definitely work on every platform.

## Dependencies

`Gradle` dependency (for desktop LibGDX project):

```
compile "com.crashinvaders.lml:gdx-autumn-fcs:$libVersion.$gdxVersion"  
```

`$libVersion` is the current version of the library, usually following `MAJOR.MINOR` schema. `$gdxVersion` is the LibGDX version used to build (and required by) the library. You can check the current library version [here](http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|g%3A%22com.github.czyzby%22) - or you can use the [snapshots](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/com/github/czyzby/).
