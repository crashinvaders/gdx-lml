Newest change logs are in the `README.md` file.

# LML 1.X

1.5 -> 1.6

- Macro marker was changed from `@` to `:`. While it required to switch a single character in the actual source code, this is actually a major update. This change breaks all LML templates that used any macro tags. `@` was a poor choice in the first place: it can be confused with the i18n bundle marker (also `@`) and is not a valid XML character. Since `DTD` supported was added, invalid macro sign was no longer an option. Quick conversion tip: replace `<@` and `</@` with `<:` and `</:` in all `*.lml` files.
- Removed `/*` alias for comment macro. Since `DTD` creator was added to LML, now it is possible to create templates that are somewhat-valid `XML` files. `/*` was the only default tag that used forbidden `XML` characters.
- New actor: `AnimatedImage`. Extends the regular `Image`; manages an array of drawables updated on `act` method. Allows to display a set of images in the specified way. Available through `animatedImage` tag.
- Proper `<!DOCTYPE>` tag parsing according to the XML standards. Added helper methods: `LmlSyntax#getDocumentTypeOpening()`, `LmlTemplateReader#startsWith(CharSequence)`. These interface modifications will not affect your applications unless you modified or extended LML internals.
- Major internal API change: `AbstractLmlTag` now consumes `StringBuilder` instead of `String` in its constructor. If you had any custom tags created in Java, this change will break your classes. The good news: using `StringBuilders` should slightly limit the amount of created objects (less garbage to collect!).
- Proper attribute parsing. To use a space character in attributes before you had to escape it with `\`. Valid attributes with whitespaces - like `message="You have died!"` would have to look as awkward as this: `message="You\ have\ died!"`, otherwise parser would separate it into 3 parts: `message="You, have, died!"`. Now whitespace escaping is completely removed: instead, all you have to do is use quotation.
- Most macros now support named parameters: conditional macros support `test`, import macros - `path`, `replace`, logging macros - `log`, loop macro: `times`, assignment macros - `key`, `value`, evaluation macros - `method`, `id`, exception macro - `message`, `strict`. DTD creator will now extract expected macro and put them in the file. This does *not* break existing templates, as named parameters are optional. This change was made to make LML more XML-friendly.
- Added `Dtd#saveSchema` and `Dtd#saveMinifiedSchema` methods, which should be preferred over `getSchema`.
- Generated DTD files are now valid and should be properly recognized by most IDEs.
- `progressBar` and `slider` tags, previously completely non-parental, can parse text between their tags - provided that it's a valid float. The parsed number will be set their initial value. Note that it's *not* a simple `value` attribute alias: `value` attribute is parsed *before* the actor is created, so it cannot trigger any registered change listeners. On the other hand, data between tags is parsed *after* actor is created (and has processed its attributes), so it *can* trigger the listeners.
- Added `onClick`, `onChange`, `onInput` tags and `:onClick`, `:onChange`, `:onInput` macros that allow to attach specialized listeners to actors. When the event occurs, children actor of the listener tags are added to the stage. Useful for displaying dialogs. See Javadocs or updated `gdx-lml-tests` and `gdx-lml-vis-tests` for more informations and usage examples.
- Added `LmlApplicationListener` - an abstract `ApplicationListener` implementation that manages a set of `AbstractLmlViews`. What LibGDX `Game` is to `Screen`, this is the same thing to `AbstractLmlView`. Includes support for smooth view transitions and registers some default actions available in all templates. Highly customizable. See updated `gdx-lml-vis-websocket` example project that uses this utility class.
- Expanded `AbstractLmlView` API with optional methods: `getTemplateFile(), pause(), resume(), hide(), show(), clear()`. By default, they do nothing (well, one of them returns `null`).
- To keep less meta-data and make DTD smaller, multiple aliases were removed. Thanks to this change, LML creates and keeps less objects and the DTD schemas are now acceptable. Note that this is likely to break your LML templates, but you can prevent that by using `lmlParser.getSyntax().addTagProvider(new SomeActorLmlTagProvider(), "yourFavoriteAlias");` or `lmlParser.getSyntax().addMacroTagProvider(new SomeMacroLmlMacroTagProvider(), "yourFavoriteMacroAlias");`. While I understand that some aliases were useful and less verbose than class names, LML aims to keep as little data at runtime as possible and now it is even more important with DTD around. See `DefaultLmlSyntax` for the leftover aliases. A few unmentioned obscure attribute aliases were removed. Now each actor is mapped to tag name that represents it's class name. Removed the following aliases:
  - Actor:  `"empty", "mock", "blank", "placeholder"`. Both `"actor"` and `"group`` are still available. 
  - CheckBox: `"check"`.
  - Container: `"single"`.
  - Dialog: `"popup"`.
  - HorizontalGroup: `"horizontal"`.
  - Image: `"img", "icon"`.
  - Label: `"text", "txt", "li"`.
  - List: `"ul"`.
  - ProgressBar: `"progress", "loadingBar", "loading"`.
  - ScrollPane: `"scroll", "scrollable"`.
  - SelectBox: `"select"`.
  - SplitPane: `"split", "splitable"`.
  - Table: `"div", "td", "th", "tr"`.
  - TextArea: `"inputArea", "multilineInput"`.
  - TextButton: `"a"`.
  - TextField: `"input", "textInput"`.
  - Touchpad: `"touch"`.
  - Tree: `"root"`.
  - VerticalGroup: `"vertical"`.
  - Actor macro: `"widget"`.
  - Any not null macro: `"anyExists", "anyPresent"`.
  - Argument macro: `"i18n", "bundle"`.
  - Argument replace macro: `"replaceArgs", "argumentsReplace", "argsReplace", "noOperation", "doNothing"`.
  - Assign macro: `"toArgument"`.
  - Calculation macro: `"equation", "calc"`.
  - Conditional (if) macro: `"try", "verify", "inspect", "validate", "onCondition", "condition", "conditional"`.
  - Evaluation macro: `"invokeAndAssign", "evaluateAndAssign"`.
  - Exception macro: `"throwException", "throwError", "system.exit"`. (It still hurts.)
  - For each macro: `"iterate", "iterateOver"`.
  - Absolute import macro: `"absoluteInclude", "absoluteRequire", "absoluteTemplate"`.
  - Classpath import macro: `"classpathInclude", "classpathRequire", "classpathTemplate"`.
  - External import macro: `"externalInclude", "externalRequire", "externalTemplate"`.
  - Internal import macro: `"include", "require", "template", "internalInclude", "internalRequire", "internalTemplate"`.
  - Local import macro: `"localInclude", "localRequire", "localTemplate"`.
  - Loop macro: `"repeat"`.
  - For each nested macro: `"nestedForEach", "nest", "nestedLoop"`.
  - New attribute macro: `"createAttribute", "newProperty"`.
  - New tag macro: `"createTag", "newActor"`.
  - Null check macro: `"allNotNull", "ifPresent", "ifExists", "nullCheck", "ifTrue"`.
  - Table column macro: `"columnDefaults"`.
  - Table row macro: `"addRow", "newRow", "nextLine", "nextRow", "tr", "rowDefaults"`.
  - Conditional loop (while) macro: `"whileTrue", "repeatWhile", "untilTrue"`.
- Added `LmlParserListener` interface that allows you to hook up into `LmlParser` events. You can register this simple functional interface to listen to pre- or post-parsing events (or both).
- Internal API change: added missing `LmlTemplateReader#append(CharSequence, String)` method. Every other significant appending method had its named equivalent - now `CharSequence` variant has it as well. Some utility methods in internal abstract macros were refactored to return/consume `CharSequences` instead of `Strings` - this is unlikely to affect your application's code, though.
- `LmlTag#handleDataBetweenTags(String)` was changed to `LmlTag#handleDataBetweenTags(CharSequence)`. Now, instead of pre-built `String` object, this method receives raw `StringBuilder` instance. This requires additional precautions when writing custom macros, as this method's argument now cannot be directly passed to `appendTextToParse` method without processing it first (putting data in another `StringBuilder` or using `toString()` manually). This is meant to limit unnecessary `String` objects creations. This change will break your custom macros created in Java (or some highly customized actor tags, but this shouldn't be the case).
- Now tables (and all widgets that extend it) are not always packed after all their children are added. Now you have to use `pack="true"` attribute to ensure that the widget is packed. Note that this change should will not break any existing templates - actors added directly to stage are still packed. This was changed to allow creating custom-sized buttons outside of tables, that would not override their size settings with `pack()` call.
- Added `LmlTag#getManagedObject()`. (Note: this is mostly internal API. Abstract bases implement this method, so if you have any custom tags, chances are this won't affect you.) This method should be invoked to get an instance of the actual managed object of the tag, which might be useful in case of non-actor tags (tooltips, validators). This can be used to extract attributes specific to the wrapped object, for example. Thanks to this modification, `gdx-lml-vis` now generates its DTD schema without any warnings in non-strict mode.

This version brought a lot of optimizations and made LML syntax fully XML-friendly. Be aware that updating to `1.6` might break your existing custom Java macros/tags due to method refactoring: a lot of functions now consume and return `CharSequence` instances instead of `Strings` to limit unnecessary `String` creations. It's worth noting that `String` and `StringBuilder` implement `CharSequence`, so now you should expect that your `CharSequence` parameter might be a builder - be careful when assigning its instance, as it might (and probably *will*) be modified. `@` instead of `:` as default macro marker will obviously break most of old LML templates, but this is a pretty easy fix.

If you're worried about frequent syntax changes or major interface refactoring - don't be. I'm fully satisfied with the current state of LML, as it can finally be used to create valid XML files and tries to create as little new objects as possible during parsing of your templates. Currently I plan on fixing any bugs that somehow passed my testing and - if anything sensible is requested - adding new features. No major syntax changes or refactorings are planned in the near future: you're safe to update your templates and enjoy polished DTD support.

1.5.1.8.0 -> 1.5.1.9.2

- Now when parsing a string value, a single character will not be treated as bundle line, preference or action (etc.) - even if it matches `@`, `$` or any other functional character. So, `$` will be parsed to `"$"`, but `$$$` will still look for an action (mapped to `$$` key). This is a simple convenience for printing a single character - these cannot be properly used as property names or bundle lines (and so on) anyway, as at least 2 characters are required. Note that if you want to use multiple restricted characters, you can always use i18n bundles.
- *DTD* file generator. Now you can generate a *DTD* file based on your customized `LmlParser` with `Dtd` class.

1.4 -> 1.5

- `argument` macro added. Contrary to `assign` macro, this macro evaluates passed arguments. For example, `assign` macro would assign `@someBundleLine` to argument name, while `argument` value would convert it to `Actual bundle line value in .properties file.` and assign it to the argument. See `ArgumentLmlMacroTag` for more informations.
- Ranges now accept bundle lines, preferences and methods. For example, now you can customize range size with i18n bundle file: `range[@start,@end]`, provided that `.properties` file has numeric `start` and `end` lines.
- Equations (available through `if`, `while` and `calculate` macros) now parse bundle lines and preferences. For example, `<@if @someLine < 20>` will check if bundle line mapped to `someLine` is shorter than 20 characters in the current locale.
- Equation marker. Now equations can be used pretty much anywhere, using mechanism similar to arguments. Normally, you insert parser arguments `{likeThat}` - this will look for an argument named `likeThat` and replace the braces block with its value (or `null`). To use equation instead, add `=` character at the beginning. For example, `{=3+5}` will replace the block with `8`. Bundle lines, preferences and methods are also supported by these equations. Equation marker aims to be a simplified alternative to `calculate` macro. As usual: to change equation marker, extend `DefaultLmlSyntax` class and override appropriate method. See new equations example in `gdx-lml-tests`.

1.3 -> 1.4

- `PooledList` is now used instead of `LinkedList`, which should slightly speed up the parsing (as in: limit its garbage collection) thanks to cached nodes and iterators.

1.2 -> 1.3

- `ButtonGroup` support through specialized `Table` extension: `ButtonTable`. `<buttonTable>` tag works like a regular table (can have any children), except it adds all its direct `Button`-extending children to an internal `ButtonGroup` instance, validating their checked status. This allows to easily build groups of widgets with min and max amounts of checked buttons.
- `image` (with `icon` alias) attribute available for `ImageButton` and `ImageTextButton`. These attributes replace `imageUp` drawable in buttons' styles: if this is the only drawable in the style, it will be always drawn on the button. You can just use a single style without any icons and manage buttons' images through these LML attributes.

1.1 -> 1.2

- `@LmlInject` annotation. When a view is created by the parser, its annotated fields are processed. In previous versions, this meant that all `@LmlActor`- and `@OnChange`-annotated fields had to be present in one class, which could quickly lead to fields flood in view classes. Now you can keep `@LmlActor`- and `@OnChange`-annotated fields in another container class and request to inject(/fill) it with `@LmlInject`. Also, `LmlParser` instance used to initiate the view can be injected. More in the annotation docs. `@LmlInject` examples were added to the example project.
- The old enum `TableTarget` was renamed to `StandardTableTarget`; `TableTarget` is now an interface. `StandardTableTarget` behavior is now modifiable. This allows to use custom multi-table widgets. 
- All attribute and tag-registering methods of `DefaultLmlSyntax` are now protected, even these previously omitted. This allows to easily extend this class.
- `prefRows` attribute added to TextArea tags.
- Previously omitted attributes of `TextField` - `cursor` (`setCursorPosition(int)`) and `textAlign` (`setAlignment(int)`) - are now properly registered and available (with a few aliases), like in LML 0.
- Now building attributes (values needed in widget constructors) are assigned to builder types rather than specific actors. This means that when a tag uses a specific builder, it will have all attributes connected with the builder automatically attached. Before, each building attribute processor had an array of actors that it supported, which wasn't very flexible when you used custom actors/tags.
- `ScrollPane` scrolling disabling (on X and Y axis) attributes fixed.
- New `TextField` attributes. If `digitsOnly` (or `numeric`) attribute is set to true, text field's filter will be set to `DigitsOnlyFilter`, allowing only numbers to be entered. `textFieldListener` (with a few aliases, as always) expects an action ID of a method that consumes a `Character`; this method will be invoked each time a char is entered. `filter` attribute expects a method that consumes a `Character` and returns a boolean; the method will be invoked each time a character is typed and if it returns false, the character will not be appended to the text field.
- Logging macros. Using LibGDX `Application` methods, this allows for easy multi-platform logging from within LML templates. Both content between tags and attributes are logged. `Lml` class allows to disable each logging level and change logger tag. See examples project for more info.
- Added `DISABLE_COMPONENT_ACTORS_ATTRIBUTE_PARSING` setting in `Lml` class. Now you can force the widgets to parse only its own attributes, even if they consist of multiple actors. See field's doc for more info.
- New abstract base for simple `Group`-extending actors: `AbstractGroupLmlTag`.
- `@LmlBefore` and `@LmlAfter` annotations. When using view-filling methods of `LmlParser`, you can annotate your view's methods with these annotations to make them automatically invoked before and after LML template parsing. Annotated methods can be either no-arg or consume a single argument: `LmlParser`. `@LmlBefore` methods are invoked after the view is registered as `ActionContainer` (if it implements this interface) and before the parsing has started. `@LmlAfter` methods are invoked after LML template is parsed, view's fields are all processed and view is no longer registered as an action container.
- Before, when using view-filling methods of `LmlParser`, view instance was added as an `ActionContainer` with ID extracted from `LmlView` method, but if the view implemented `ActorConsumer`, it was not available in templates. Now, if the view class implements both `ActorConsumer` and `LmlView`, view will be registered as an action with ID extracted from `LmlView` method.

1.0 -> 1.1:

- Dialog parents now add plain text to content table rather than themselves, which matches LML 0 behavior.
- `oneColumn` attribute added to tables. If a table has `oneColumn=true` attribute, its main table will append row after each child. If the table is a dialog, its content table will append rows after each child.
- `appendActorsToStage(Stage, Array<Actor>)` moved from `AbstractLmlParser` to `LmlUtilities`. Now you can easily append your actors result to a stage, honoring `StageAttacher` settings - even if you do not use to default `fillStage` or `createView` methods of `LmlParser`.
- LML keeps some meta-data about the widgets using `Actor#setUserObject(Object)` method. Some of it might still be useful after LML parsing, like stage attachers (they specify how actors are added to the `Stage`). Still, you might want to remove the unnecessary user objects with little effort: and now that's possible using `LmlUtilities#clearLmlUserObjects(Iterable<Actor>)` and `LmlUtilities#clearLmlUserObject(Actor)`, both of which offer removing user objects of the passed actors and their children, if they happen to be actor groups. As a rule of thumb, if you have added your actors to the stage (or used one of automatic stage-filling parser methods) and don't plan to remove&add them again, it is safe to clear LML meta-data.
- Fixed a bug where default horizontal and vertical styles were inverted.

0 -> 1:

This is the biggest update to LML yet. Actually, the whole parsing mechanism was rewritten from scratch (sic!), as it contained a lot of quick, dirty, uncommented code and wasn't very user-friendly when it came to expanding or modifying. Learning on my mistakes, the new LML is parsed much faster, allows to customize a lot more settings (including the syntax itself, which previously contained a lot of static final values) and makes creating custom attributes or tags from less painful to completely painless. If you used LML before, your templates will most likely break after this update, but the fixes are usually easy enough to endure. Core syntax and API changes:

- LML arguments changed from `${dollarSignProceeded}` to `{simplifiedSyntax}`. There was no need for the sign, really, except maybe being a little more similar to FreeMarker (if I remember correctly, this is were I originally got it from). Eventually, I realized that: A) `{}` are never used in templates in any other way anyway, no need for an extra marker, B) this is an extra character that could be easily avoided, after all (AND WE ALL CARE FOR THAT EXTRA BYTE WE SAVE), C) it is often proceeded with a bundle or preference marker, resulting in `#${weirdSyntax}`, that is `@${moreMysterious}` as opposed to `#{that}` or `@{this}`.
- Method invocation operator changed from '&' to '$'. It was misleading and difficult to parse in equations/conditions (as there is also the '&' bit operator). Since actions are used MOSTLY in attributes that expect methods (onClick, onChange and so on) and these do not and did not require the operator to be present, this shouldn't break most of old templates.
- Range separator changed from `minus[0-4]` to `comma[0,2]`. Minus doesn't really allow for proper parsing of negative ranges without some extra effort that could be easily avoided (not to mention that even parsed correctly, they still looked strange), and it was certainly one of my design mistakes. Note that ranges CANNOT USE any of the reserved array or range characters prior to the actual range choosing to work properly. For example, `this,mightGetParsed]Incorrectly[0,4]`. As a rule of thumb, you should use only letters and numbers for IDs. 
- Attributes assignment got unified. If, for example, an iteration macro used to assign elements with `:`, now it will use `=`, as any other tag attribute. For example, instead of `<@forEach element:range[0-2]>`, now you will write `<@forEach element=range[0,2]>`.
- The biggest change of all: now you can MODIFY the syntax. Well, not the structure at its core (as in: XML-like structure stays), but you can change pretty much ANY syntax character by implementing `LmlSyntax` or overriding `DefaultLmlSyntax` and choosing your own characters. Want to use different parenthesis or want some old "feature" back? Sure, why not. I decided to use characters instead of strings for simplified parsing and smaller template files.
- Pretty much all values are now ignoring case, starting from tags and attributes (as it used to be), ending with LML argument names (`{argument}` maps to the same value as `{Argument}`) and actor IDs (`id=this` is the same as `id=THIS`), which are the new standards. It is only natural to use completely different IDs for all actors and to keep your arguments not confusing, but if you did use IDs that vary only with their case, you might want to refactor your templates. Just to be clear: both `<LABEL>` and `<label>` tags will be properly parsed as Labels, but if you try to combine different cases for one widget like this: `<label></LABEL>`, this will throw an exception (if the parser is strict).
- Attributes are now registered globally, rather than attached to each tag parser. This means that now attributes can validated by a strict parser and throw exceptions for typos - no more unknown, invalid, unnoticed tag attributes.
- Package changes. Since almost the whole thing was rewritten, the few classes that remained nearly unchanged might have been moved from their original packages in the process. `@ViewAction` was renamed to `@LmlAction`, since I don't want to mix View-related annotations (which should be clearly in my other project, Autumn MVC) with pure LML-related stuff. The name was sort of confusing anyway, and now its both (arguably) easier to find with code assist and one letter shorter (YEAH! YET ANOTHER BYTE SAVED TODAY).
- Completely changed tag and attribute parsers. If you had custom ones, they will not work anymore. The tag and attribute structure is much more pleasant to expand and manage, though, so I'm pretty sure it won't be very hard to update your custom classes.
- `LmlParser` API was simply too big. Instead of just parsing templates, it had to manage a lot of extra data - like skin, i18n bundles, preferences, actions, etc. Some of its old functionalities are moved into several other interfaces (with their default implementations): `LmlData` manages arguments, skins, bundles and so on, `LmlSyntax` contains parsers of attributes, macros and tags and `LmlTemplateReader` takes care of efficient reading of parsed templates character by character.
- `<row>` tag removed, as tags are supposed to create unique actors. `row=true` attribute is usually more convenient, but since row tag could be used to set row defaults, `<@row>` macro was added to support this functionality. Also, `<@column>` macro as added to support column defaults setting. See `TableColumnLmlMacroTag` and `TableRowLmlMacroTag` docs.
- Missing action exceptions are now more meaningful and usually contain both missing action ID and the argument that the action was supposed to consume.

LML 1.0 brings:

- JavaDocs, JavaDocs, JavaDocs. In previous versions, only `Lml` class had proper comments - now every class and every public and protected method has a hopefully meaningful comment. To be honest and not-so-modest, I think that going through comments of `LmlSyntax` and source of `DefaultLmlSyntax`, for example, is a great way to start with LML right now. Every actor, macro and attribute parser now describes what it parses, what it is prepared to parse and how to use it. Most of the classes that might need extension from time to time (for example: adding a new button tag attribute) are much easier to expand in LML 1.0. I've also tried to include some LML syntax examples (tag and macro usages, etc.) where I thought it might be useful. Seriously, go through the JavaDocs.
- Refactored and faster parsing: template parsing used to be... heavy (converting-string-to-char-array-and-then-into-linked-list-of-characters and using-a-lot-of-regexes-to-code-this-faster kind of heavy), but now a lot of more lightweight methods are used. Even before it took a fraction of second on modern CPUs to parse, but still the new version should be noticeably faster, especially on mobile devices. Cheap splits by a single character, efficient macro arguments' replacements and sensible iteration over strings' characters were implemented to make template parsing efficient.
- Full LibGDX tooltips support, including using custom tooltip managers. Tooltip tag attribute is removed, but tooltip tag works just like before: its basically a Table wrapped with LibGDX Tooltip API.
- Actor injection without Autumn MVC! Now you can annotate your fields with `@LmlActor("id")` and use one of parser's `createView` methods to fill your view with parsed actors. You can also attach a listener that will constantly update one of view's fields according to an actor state with `@OnChange("actorId")` (this will work only on widgets that get sensible change events, like check boxes or sliders). To fill view's stage, implement optional `LmlView` interface and watch as the parser does all your widget management work for you.
- Nested comments. You can optionally turn on nested comments setting to enjoy comments that can span over multiple other comments. However, this sacrifices the freedom of keeping broken comment tags inside your comments: to exit the comment properly, the nested comments HAVE to be valid. This does not match HTML behavior. 
- `@comment` macro. Basically, this macro ignores whatever it has between its tags. This is an alternative (and the preferred) way to use nested comments that might span over multiple lines and standard comments. This macro is available under `comment, todo, fixme, /*` tag names. Yes, `<@/*>this is a comment, even if it looks weird.</@/*>` As with any macro, it can include nested macro tags with the same name, but they have to be properly opened and closed; if you want to use multiple nested comment macros, use different case (might just work, especially if the parser is strict) or their aliases to make sure that the commented-out text can contain invalid tags and whatnot.
- Multiple skins support. You can specify which skin should be used for which widget with `skin` tag attribute. If attribute is not passed, skin mapped to default key is used. Note that some attributes rely on skin usage (for example: `color` attribute, which needs a skin to find a color by name), but do not have direct access to the skin used to construct the widget, as most actors do not keep that reference. It is safe to assume that skin attribute should be used ONLY to select the initial style of the widget and other skin-using-attributes will still rely on default skin.
- `@evaluate` and `@actor` macros got more powerful. Now you can pass string attributes to your methods - text between evaluation macro tags will be passed as method arguments. See `EvaluateLmlMacroTag` and `ActorLmlMacroTag` docs for examples and more info.
- Proper condition parsing. Now `@if` macro can look like this: `<@if ($someAction == 13) || ({someString} < 7) || ((--{loop:index}) == (++{for:index}))>`. Since calculations are so powerful right now, `@calculate` macro was added: it works pretty much like an `@assign` macro, except it expects an equation instead of literal value. Result of the equation will be assigned to a parser `{attribute}`. See `ConditionalLmlMacroTag` and `CalculationLmlMacroTag` for more info.
- `@replaceArguments` macro. This allows to locally override LML `{arguments}`, by assigning new values with its attributes. Passing no attributes to the macro is a safe no-op. See `ArgumentReplacementLmlMacroTag` docs. 
- `@exception` macro. Ever wanted to throw an exception with a meaningful message from within LML template without dirty hacks like `</iShouldNeverBeThere/>`? This macro does exactly that. It expects one (optional) boolean attribute: if it is true, exception is always thrown; if false, exception is thrown only if parser is strict. Content between macro tags is appended as exception reason message.
- `@newTag` macro. Now you can create new `<actorTags>` from within LML templates, not only `<@macros>`. First argument is tag names array, second is a method ID that takes an instance of LmlActorBuilder (contains skin, style) and returns an actor. All attributes that apply to the actor's superclass will also apply to your custom actor. For example, if you return an instance of Table, it will be able to have children (like a regular Table) and all cell/table attributes will be honored. Before, you had to create custom tag parsers, now you just have to define one method and invoke a macro. More informations in NewTagLmlMacroTag. There is also `@newAttribute` macro, but to be honest - with the new attribute parsing syntax (`LmlAttribute` interface), there's little reason to use it, as creating attributes directly in Java requires almost as much setup (which is "almost none"). Still, check NewAttributeLmlMacroTag.
- Exceptions now contain A LOT more data about the errors and add currently parsed template part to the message. In LML 0, if an exception was thrown during macro parsing, you were pretty much f&%$#d. Now, the exception will contain evaluated macro content with a separate line counter, allowing you to determine which macro's line was problematic.
- Support for previously unavailable widgets: Container, Touchpad, SelectBox, ImageButton, ImageTextButton. This basically covers every notable non-meant-to-be-semi-abstract widget in Scene2D.
- `onClose` tag attribute. As opposed to `onCreate` (which was available before), `onClose` actions are invoked after widget's tag is closed and all its children are appended, rather than invoking the action right after the widget instance is created. This is very convenient for complex tags with multiple children, like trees and tables. There are probably a few things missing, overlooked in the huge Scene2D, but remember that using  these two attributes you can always set pretty much anything that Scene2D allows to change - create a method that consumes an instance of the actor type you want to modify, do your stuff in Java and reference the method in the LML template.
- Updated example project: now it has all tags and macros explained. Make sure to check it out!

Quick LML 0-to-1 template conversion guide:

- Replace `${` with `{` (`$` marker removed from arguments).
- Replace `&` with `$` (action marker changed to `$`).
- Replace `:` with `=` in loops (assignment markers unified).
- Replace `-` with `,` in ranges (range separator changed to easily support negative ranges).
- Replace `<row>` tags (and its old aliases) with `<@row>` macro.

Unless you've used some weird hacks or unusual conditions in `if` macro (which now is a lot more powerful and doesn't support all of its old hacky operators), your old templates should work after these changes.

# LML 0.X

0.8 -> 0.9.1.7.0-SNAPSHOT:

Use snapshot for the "new" features if you really want to stick with LML 0. The last "stable" LML 0 version is 0.8.1.7.0.

- `@actor` macro. Looks for an action with the passed ID, invokes it (expecting an Actor) and adds the returned Actor to the current parent tag. For example, if you use `<@actor myMethodName />` tag inside `<table>...</table>` tags, your actor returned by `myMethodName` action will be added to the table. Useful if you want to create an actor from scratch without adding a new actor tag parser.
- Array-parsing macros (*forEach*, *nested*, etc.) now support methods that return object arrays. Before you had to manually convert arrays to iterables to properly handle method invocations; now simple object arrays can be returned and each of its elements will be safely converted to string. Primitive arrays are not supported (yet?).
- Now conditional macros (like *if*, *notNull*) evaluate to "false" if they receive no arguments, rather than throwing an exception. This might be especially useful when using nullable LML arguments (for example, `${someEmptyStringArgument}` would cause to print part after `<@if:else/>` when passed to *if* macro: `<@if ${someEmptyStringArgument}>`).
- Removed custom tooltips (which were kind of cool with their moving along with the mouse and jumping when near an edge, but still - now there's "native" support). Since LibGDX tooltips are not actors, `tooltipId` attribute is no longer supported. Old tooltip tags still work: any actor can have a TextTooltip attached with a customized style by using `tooltip` (content) and `tooltipStyle` (name of TextTooltipStyle in skin) attributes; if `tooltip` is an action (`&proceededWithThat`) and the action returns an Actor, `Tooltip<Actor>` will be created instead. As a separate tag, `<tooltip>...</tooltip>` still works like a table - internally, `Tooltip<Table>` will be created and all new tags between the tooltip entities will be added to the table; all table attributes are supported, so you can specify `background`, `oneColumn`, `tablePad`, etc. Tooltip tag can have two additional attributes: `always` and `instant`, which trigger its setter methods (as you might expect).

0.7 -> 0.8:

- Color tag attributes. Now it is possible to set actor's color from within the LML templates. `color` attribute expects either a method (or field) name that returns a Color, or a String which is the name of a color present in .json Skin. You can also manually set each color value with `r`, `red`, `b`, `blue`, `g`, `green`, `a` and `alpha` attributes - these will expect a float. These attributes are available to all actor tags, as they use only the Actor's API.

0.7.1.6.4 -> 0.7.1.6.5:

- Missing `maxLength` attribute for TextField and TextArea now supported.
- Null check macro can now be invoked without attributes and will not throw exceptions; instead it works as if it would receive null or false (shows "else" variant).
- Empty LML document will not throw exceptions on parsing; instead, it returns an empty array of actors, as you would expect.
- Note that even though LibGDX now supports tooltips, for now the initial LML mechanism is still used. `<tooltip>` tag still works similarly to a table, which can be filled with any widgets and is shown after a short delay.
 
0.6 -> 0.7:

- Wiki page with all tags and attributes is being created. Stay tuned.
- Added "disabled" attribute to ProgressBar.
- @ViewAction now takes an array of strings as action IDs. This won't break existing code, while allowing to map the selected method by multiple IDs.
- New common tag attribute: userObject. Allows to assign a custom object to the actor by using Actor#setUserObject method. If action operator is used (&), method will be found and executed - its result will be assigned as the user object; in other cases, string value of the attribute is set. Be careful - some widgets (Dialogs, Windows, Tooltips) use the same mechanism to store stage/actor attachment data; however, this attribute should be safe to use for actors that are not roots (as in not directly added to stage).
- Extended tooltip support. Now you can attach tooltips to actors by adding a `<tooltip>` tag inside them. Tooltip works pretty much like table, so you can fully customize tooltips' look and layout. Tooltip tag has 3 extra settings (additionally to all table attributes): fadingTime, movingTime, showingDelay (all in seconds; see Tooltip docs). Child `<tooltip/>` tag is NOT advised (especially since there is no way to set its content) - tooltips should be added with parental tags (`<tooltip>...</tooltip>`).

0.5 -> 0.6:

- LML drops Autumn dependency thanks to method annotation API in LibGDX 1.6.0. Now ActionContainers using @ViewAction annotation need to be GWT-reflected in a standard LibGDX way and Autumn is no longer needed.
- onComplete attribute added to ProgressBar (and Slider). This expects an action which will be invoked once the progress bar reaches 100%.

0.4 -> 0.5:

- Changed window tags according to the new, refactored API in LibGDX 1.5.6. Now dialogs can also add children to the title table - see `DialogLmlParent` (`toTitleTable` will append tag children to the title table rather than the content).
- LML now uses [Autumn](http://github.com/crashinvaders/gdx-autumn) for method annotations (NOTE: Autumn dependency removed in 0.6), which are not normally supported by LibGDX reflection API. You can use `@ViewAction` annotation on `ActionContainer`s' methods to assign the method to a chosen ID, which can be referenced in template instead of method name. While requiring more work, this allows for method names refactoring without breaking the templates (as long as annotations are untouched). If you're planning on using this annotation on GWT, however, you have to register the container for Autumn reflection - see its documentation for more details: [Autumn GWT](http://github.com/crashinvaders/gdx-autumn-gwt). As long as you don't use the `@ViewAction` annotation, you don't have to worry about Autumn.
- `ActionContainer`s fields can be also referenced just like methods. If LML parser is unable to find method with the given ID/name, it will check if the class contains a field with that name - if it does, field's value converted to string will be returned instead of a method result. This, of course, should not be used for events (`onClick`, for example), but it will do just fine for titles, labels etc. This functionality, however, causes problems on - who would guess - GWT, as LibGDX reflection implementation does not seem to throw exceptions or return null for invalid field names - from what I can see, it returns broken objects that throw runtime exceptions on invocations. This is not a problem as long as you have only one action container or reference all action containers' methods with their prefixed ID (as in &someContainer.someMethod), but I can imagine it might get tedious and field extraction may be rarely used, so you can turn off field extraction by setting `Lml.EXTRACT_FIELDS_AS_METHODS` to false.
- Methods without parameters can now be referenced in templates. As you might guess, these are invoked without parameters instead of consuming the enclosing actor.
- @evalute macro. Finds a method (has to consume an Object argument or no arguments) and invokes it. First parameter has to be a method ID (& operator is optional); if a second argument is given, result of the found method will be converted to string and assigned as a parser argument (which you can ${reference} in LML templates) with the name matching the second macro argument, case sensitive. This macro cannot be parental. Aliases: evaluate, eval, invoke.
- User-defined macros just got a lot less awkward to use thanks to named parameters and default values. Macro syntax stays more or less the same, but now you can reference only the chosen parameters (in any order) by proceeding them with their name and "=" (like any other tag argument). Quotations are escaped (and optional). First argument determines if the macro arguments are named - you cannot use both named and unnamed arguments, as it would be near to impossible to determine correct argument order. For example:

```
<@macro body;skeleton content title="Hello!" includeLabel=false>
    <window title=${title}>
        <@if ${includeLabel}>
             <label>Label!</label>
        </@if>
        ${content}
        ${content}
    </window>
</@macro>

```
The macro declaration above registers a new macro under `body` and `skeleton` names. Text between macro tags is injected twice as ${content} attribute. `title` argument defaults to `Hello!` if not given and `includeLabel` is false by default.

The general macro syntax is: `<@macro arrayOfNames contentArgument anyAmountOfNamedArgumentsWithOrWithoutDefaultValue> MACRO CONTENT </@macro>`. Macro names are generally separated by ; - these can also reference ranges and actions. (See LML forum post for more info.) All appearances of ${contentArgument} - any name of the argument can be chosen, of course. If only macro name is given, content argument defaults to ${MACRO}. Argument names are case-sensitive.

Some example invocations:

```
<@body/>
<!-- BECOMES: -->
<window title=Hello!>
</window>

<@body includeLabel=true />
<!-- BECOMES: -->
<window title=Hello!>
    <label>Label!</label>
</window>

<@skeleton includeLabel=true title="Hey!">
	<textbutton>My content.</textbutton>
</@skeleton>
<!-- BECOMES: -->
<window title=Hey!>
    <label>Label!</label>
    <textbutton>My content.</textbutton>
    <textbutton>My content.</textbutton>
</window>
```

As you can see - pretty simple and much less awkward than `<@body "" true />`, for example. Be careful with spaces though - macros are parsed a little differently and they are not huge fans of spaces in arguments, even escaped ones. Use i18n bundle texts instead (@).
